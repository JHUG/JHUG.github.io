            Presentation Summary*: For evaluation only; this is an additional description of your proposal to help the reviewers better understand your submission.

      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
            Session titles should be descriptive of the content and use common keywords. Write an abstract that is easy to read and describes the value of the presentation. An example of a useful title is: Five techniques to improve your Java server logging. An example of an uninformative and vague title: Java GC and You. Do explicitly discuss what your session is about rather than making a strategy pitch. For example, include specifics about case studies, customer/partner participation, quantitative facts, etc.
