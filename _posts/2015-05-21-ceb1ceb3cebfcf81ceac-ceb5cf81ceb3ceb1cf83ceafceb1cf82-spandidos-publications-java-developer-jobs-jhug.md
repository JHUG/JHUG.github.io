Spandidos Publications a scientific publisher with a long-standing international reputation for excellent standards and high quality science publications is seeking to recruit a Java web application developer  (min 2 years of experience) with a passion for clean code. In addition to core Java programming skills you must have experience with Spring (Core, MVC and Security) and an ORM (Hibernate or JPA). This is Web Developer role so you must have a good knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS & Javascript).

If you have any experience with Apache ActiveMQ (JMS) or Jackrabbit (JCR) that would be good but is not essential so long as you have strong  technical English reading skills.  
An ability to communicate with non-technical co-workers and customers is essential which we will explore that at the interview stage.

The successful candidate will join a team developing the company&#8217;s website and internal workflow systems that interact with a number of external organizations. Some familiarity with XML (the lingua franca of publishing) and RESTful APIs will be useful.
