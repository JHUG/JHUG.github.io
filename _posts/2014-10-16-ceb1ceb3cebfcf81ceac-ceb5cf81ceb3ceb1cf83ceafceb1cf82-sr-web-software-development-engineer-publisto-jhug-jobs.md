If you are an engineer who understands that code best changes the world if it also changes children, then you might belong to Publisto. For the business here is not just about “customer experience” but about first experiences &#8211; and you have to give it your all: co-create a new mindset for application development on tablets and desktop environments and set the highest coding and aesthetic standards for our entire team.  
What you will be expected to know:  
·         How to build a unified cross platform application framework using both native and web technologies  
·         How to optimize design and content on a variety of devices and screen sizes and how to solve efficiency and slow network problems  
·         How to challenge candidly and lead generously a creative team of high intelligence and great ambition.

A great personality speaks through her/his work and great work speaks for itself; however these are few of the standard assets we are looking for in a candidate:  
·         Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science, Math, Physics or Electrical Engineering  
·         3+ years professional experience in software & web development  
·         Proficiency in Computer Science fundamentals &#8211; object oriented design, data structures, algorithm &#8211; design, problem solving, and complexity analysis  
·         Experience in web technologies such as PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, JQuery mobile, AJAX, HTML5 and CSS3  
·         Proficiency in at least one modern object oriented language such as Java, C++,  C#, or Python  
·         Experience building complex mobile applications on Android/iOS or mobile web with third party tools such as PhoneGap will be considered a plus  
·         Experience delivering low-latency, consumer-internet-scale web services operating in a 24&#215;7 environment  
·         Experience with Agile (SCRUM, RUP, XP), OO modeling, web services, UNIX, middleware and databases  
·         Knowledge of professional software engineering practices, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing, and operations  
·         Great analytical abilities and established design skills.

We offer an extremely competitive monthly remuneration package and the opportunity to have a fantastic learning experience to a dream destination.
